This project is a machine learning based using python, I have trained a model that help farmers in predicting the appropriate crop to be planted in a given area based on various conditions
like temperature and rainfall amount. Phosphorus and nitrogen are other factors considered.
The model have been created using random forest algorithm.
The front-end is fully built in flask for easy interaction with the peasant farmers.
The model prediction accuracy is over 98%.
